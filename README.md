# iris-flower-detection
This model is based on iris flower detection which takes the input of the flower's sepal length and width, petal length and width, and predicts which type of iris flower among the three different types of iris flowers, this model is trained with datasets from sklearn.datasets

Extra Info: Iris scanning illuminates irises with invisible infrared light to take a picture of unique patterns in each eye that are not visible to the naked eye. A special camera takes the position of the pupil, iris, eyelids, and eyelashes. Each eye gets its own unique mathematical patterns, which are further digitized.
