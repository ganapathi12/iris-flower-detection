# IRIS-fFower-detection
<p>This model is based on iris flower detection which takes input of flower's sepal length and width, petal length and width and predicts which type of iris flower amoung the three different types of iris flowers, this model is trained with datasets from sklearn.datasets</p>
#About Neural Networks
<p>Neural networks are artificial systems that were inspired by biological neural networks. These systems learn to perform tasks by being exposed to various datasets and examples without any task-specific rules. The idea is that the system generates identifying characteristics from the data they have been passed without being programmed with a pre-programmed understanding of these datasets.</p>

<p>Neural networks are based on computational models for threshold logic. Threshold logic is a combination of algorithms and mathematics. Neural networks are based either on the study of the brain or on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. The work has led to improvements in finite automata theory.</p>
